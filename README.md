# CycleServerBase
A cycle based server groundwork for use with the Runescape Emulation protocols. 

This version is used as an example of previous works and does not contain a working protocol implementation, however one can be added very simply. 

The program architecture allows for multiple servers to be ran asynchronously on a single host. Allowing cross-server communication to occur very easily.
